# Parallel Implementation of Q-Learning  
## how to run the code
- ``q-learning.cpp`` is the file contains major implementations of q-learning algorithm. ``generateMaze.cpp`` generates random sizes of mazes. ``findSolution.cpp`` finds out if any feasible solution is produced by ``q-learning.cpp``.

## Introduction  
### What is Q-Learning  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Q-Learning is a value-based Reinforcement Learning algorithm that deals with the problem of learning to control autonomous agents. The learning process works based on interactions by trial and error with a dynamic environment which provides reward signals for each action the agent executes.
